<p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious medical condition that occurs when your blood pressure
                        is persistently high. It causes no symptoms, but if left uncontrolled, it raises your risks of even more
                        serious conditions like heart attack and stroke.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that one in three adults in the U.S. is
                        battling high blood pressure 1. According to the American Heart Association in 2017, nearly half of
                        American adults have high blood pressure (and many don’t even know it.) 2 So, if you haven’t had your
                        blood pressure checked recently, you should see a doctor.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you might be concerned about taking medication to
                        lower your blood pressure. While medication can reduce high blood pressure, it may cause side effects
                        such as dizziness, leg cramps, and insomnia.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fortunately, there’s good news. You can successfully control your blood pressure naturally without medication.
                        Lifestyle changes play a huge role in controlling your high blood pressure naturally. Achieving a
                        healthy lifestyle will help you lower blood pressure naturally and quickly so that you may reduce,
                        delay, or avoid the need for medication.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are 5 ways to naturally control high blood pressure.</p>
                    <h2>1. Reduce stress</h2>
                    <p>Stress is a key contributor to high blood pressure.</p>
                    <p>Chronic stress puts your body to a constant fight-or-flight response mode. The end
                        result is a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels.  Constriction of blood vessels and
                        increase in heart rate raises blood pressure temporarily until the stress reaction goes away.19
                        Chronic stress can cause your body to go into high gear for days or weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you react to stress by drinking alcohol, smoking, or consuming unhealthy food, your blood pressure
                        level could be negatively affected.
                    </p>
                    <p>Learning how to reduce stress can help lower your blood pressure levels.
                        It will not only improve your heart health but also rejuvenate your overall well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first step to managing stress is to figure out what causes you to feel stressed, whether
                        it is finances, work, family, or illness. Once you know the cause of your stress,
                        find a way to reduce or eliminate it.
                        To fight stress, consider these stress management tips.
                    </p>
                    <p>Change your expectations- Reduce stress by practicing time management.
                        Also, avoid stressful working situations. Do not respond to difficult situations by drinking, overeating or smoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recognize where you have control- Learn to accept things you can’t change.
                        For things under your control, try to look for ways to solve them quickly. Know your stress
                        triggers and try to avoid them if possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Take care of your moods- Relaxation works wonders for stress. Even if you are busy, spare some 10-15
                        minutes a day to sit quietly, breathe deeply and have peace with yourself. Invest your time in
                        nurturing and supporting positive relations with friends, family or colleagues. Engage in regular physical
                        activities to let go of tension in your body—you’ll feel better.
                    </p>
                    <p>Research has shown that listening to soothing music can help lower blood pressure.
                        20 The calming music helps relax your nervous system, allowing the heart to pump blood more efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>Practice gratitude- Respond to stressful situations better by focusing on the positives rather than
                        the negatives. Express gratitude to others and participate in an activity that brings you pleasure and joy.
                        If it is sports or cooking that you love, enjoy taking part in such activities.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. Lose weight</h2>
                    <p>The risks of high blood pressure and other health problems are boosted with weight gain.
                        If you’re overweight, losing extra pounds can make a huge difference for your heart health.
