<p>Detoxification is still largely misunderstood by the general public who often cast it off as unconventional  medicine—at best, unorthodox, and at worse, pseudoscience.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When someone starts talking to you about doing body cleanses and getting rid of toxins, for some, it might sound like a bunch of hooey.</p>

<p>It’s funny, isn’t it?</p>

<p>We’ve been practicing modern medicine for the last hundred or so years, but the medicines mankind used for several millennia are labeled as “alternative.”</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that detoxification is a necessary process for keeping your body fit and healthy, and there are easy ways to govern this process using natural methods.</p>

<p>First, before we get into the details for the best ways to detoxify your body, we want to clear up some misconceptions about what detoxification is and what it isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="toxins-a-disturbing-reality">Toxins: A Disturbing Reality</h2>

<p>“Toxins” is not just some buzzword invented by naturalists trying to sell you a vial of snake oil. They are pollutants that exist in every element of our modern society that contaminate our bodies.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a tree-hugging environmentalist to tell you that the world today does not look like it did a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>We can leave arguments about climate change for other people to debate, because what concerns us here is more internal than it is external.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that, compared to simpler times on earth,  there is an excessive amount of  unnatural stuff silently inhabiting our air and our water—it invades our bodies and can ultimately result in numerous health issues. For the most part, this contamination process goes on unnoticed. While some contributors effects are unintentional, some of it is purposefully set in motion by corporations who genetically modify our food for greater profits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, much of the unintentional stuff gets into our bodies simply because a lot more people share a lot more space and utilities in our modern societies.</p>

<p>For example, one of the prices we pay for the luxury of modern plumbing is a shared water supply. And while this is much more preferable than the alternative, there are still some issues for which we need to keep an eye out.</p>

<p>For instance, paying our water bill is one of many tedious yet vitally important tasks that we check off of our financial responsibilities list each month. We would suggest that you also take a glance at what your monthly water quality report has to say because the information it contains tells you much more than just how much money it’s costing you each time you turn on the faucet.</p>

<p>Did you know that these reports will show you what is actually in the water you’re ingesting when you pull it straight from the tap with a mineral analysis, trace element analysis, and other analyses.</p>

<p>Now, we aren’t trying to scare you—save for a few exceptions, most water that comes out of your sink more than safe enough to drink, especially if you are using any kind of water filter. The point we want to make here is that you need to know what is in your water because there is probably some stuff in there that you’d rather not see.</p>

<p>Among the many elements you’ll see on such a report, you will see trace amounts of lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic—all of which are carcinogenic. The other thing that these elements have in common is that they can build up over time, making them potentially more dangerous the longer they go on without intervention.</p>

<p>The good news is that, since the EPA introduced tighter restrictions on the allowable amounts of these chemicals in our water, there has been a reduction in the incidence of diseases tied to these chemicals.</p>

<p>The bad news is that there is absolutely nothing the EPA can do to get rid of these chemicals completely. So, even though fewer people are affected, there are still residual amounts that are cause for concern.</p>

<p>There’s something else in our water that people, especially men, should watch out for. Xenoestrogens are foreign chemicals that act like estrogen when consumed, and they are in our public water—the most common of which is none other than fluoride.</p>

<p>Increased exposure to xenoestrogens has been inextricably linked to a decrease in testosterone production in men. Increased exposure to xenoestrogens has also been shown to increase the risk of developing breast cancer in women.</p>

<p>This is a good point to return to where we started at the beginning of this section. “Toxins” are not some imaginary compounds spun in the ghost stories of crystal wearing healers.</p>

<p>These are real contaminants that can cause very real damage to your body.</p>

<h2 id="gmos-the-real-price-of-fake-food">GMOs: The Real Price of Fake Food</h2>

<p>Like “Toxins,” when a lot of people hear the acronym, “GMO,” their eyes begin to roll.</p>

<p>There’s a tendency for people to think that GMOs (genetically modified organisms) are just the concern of environmentalists overblowing the risk of genetically altering food. After all, GMO foods are prettier, cheaper, and more plentiful—what’s the problem with that?</p>

<p>Well, first, GMO foods don’t taste as good as the real deal. Sure, they can make corn sweeter, but they can’t make a tomato more savory. In fact, jacking up the sweetness is about all that genetic engineering has been able to do to increase a food’s flavor &hellip; well, that and our waistlines.</p>

<p>But, increased sugar content aside, the real concern here is in the amount of herbicides and pesticides we consume when eating GMO products.</p>

<p>You see, in order to grow a bigger tomato, that tomato’s natural ability to ward off bugs and weeds is diminished, meaning that more herbicides and pesticides have to be sprayed on them in order to allow them to continue to grow larger.</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking, “Well, that’s why I wash my produce,” and it would be nice to think that that would be enough.</p>

<p>Sure, you may wash your produce, but do you really?</p>

<p>Better question: do you wash your produce, or do you just rinse it?</p>

<p>There’s a HUGE difference. Rinsing your produce is a great way to remove any excess dirt, get rid of stickiness left by the juices of surrounding produce, and to get that stubborn label off. All of this would be fine for a non-GMO product &hellip; but if your veggie grew up on a farm clouded in chemicals (like most), you haven’t been doing nearly enough.</p>

<p>Rinsing is not washing. To really wash produce, you have to actually scrub them with a vegetable brush. You can also soak them in a salt or vinegar solution, spray them with an acidic solution and rinse, or peel them. But this business of briefly running them under the faucet before tossing them into your salad still leaves you internally exposed to harmful chemicals. Having clean food to eat is worth an extra couple of minutes to properly wash it, right?</p>

<p>The buildup of these chemicals has been linked to “infertility, immune dysregulation, accelerated aging, dysregulation of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis, insulin regulation, cell signaling, and protein formation, and changes in the liver, kidney, spleen, and gastrointestinal system.”</p>

<p>Though more studies need to be done to show the depth of severity for these issues, we think that there is enough evidence here to suggest that this is something we should immediately be concerned about.</p>

<p>There is no denying that there is a build up of harmful chemicals floating around in your body right now, and the only way to get rid of them is through detoxification.</p>

<h2 id="the-seven-best-ways-to-detox-naturally">The Seven Best Ways to Detox Naturally</h2>

<p>Not only does detoxification clear your body of the chemicals that are so harmful to your health, but there is also the added benefit that many of these detox methods can help you lose weight, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Increase Your Water Intake</p>

<p>The most common method people take to clear their body of those nasty toxins is to increase their intake of filtered water. Be sure to invest in a good water filter to reduce your exposure to what may be lurking in your water supply.</p>

<p>Forget the old adage that you need to drink eight cups (64 oz.) of water per day. That would be enough for some, but the truth is that you should be drinking at least half an ounce of water for every pound you weigh. So, if you weigh 150 lbs., you should be drinking at least 75oz. of water every day.</p>

<p>If water is too boring for you, there are ways to make it more interesting. Check out the video below:</p></li>

 </div>


<ul>
<li><p>Go Organic</p>

<p>When you make the switch to organic, you immediately eliminate the risks associated with the exposure to herbicides and pesticides. This may seem like a more expensive investment up front, but it will decrease health costs over time.</p>

<p>Oh, and organic tastes better too, so it’s worth the money when you can do it.</p>

<p>Be sure to look for products labeled “USDA Organic” or “Non-GMO Verified.” Also look for grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, and cage-free eggs.</p>

<p>These are not just trendy words printed in green; they are your ticket to better health.</p></li>

<li><p>Eat More Greens</p>

<p>Green vegetables are nutrient-dense and filled with detoxifying properties that rid your body of unwanted chemicals.</p>

<p>When it comes to picking vegetables, it’s really a matter of the leafier, the better. Foods like kale, cabbage, broccoli, watercress, and spinach are loaded with glutathione, which helps your liver process toxins so they can easily be eliminated.</p>

<p>You can also increase these vegetables’ detoxification power by juicing them. That way, you get more nutrition in less time. You can also throw in beets and fruits that will make the drink taste sweeter and easier to consume.</p></li>

<li><p>Find a Good Daily Supplement</p>

<p>Another way to ensure that you are getting the vitamins and minerals your body needs to eliminate toxins is to take a daily supplement.</p>

<p>By taking supplements daily, your body gets all the nutrition that you may not be able to get so easily through a regular diet.</p>

<p>Nutrients like vitamin C, omega-3, and magnesium are all necessary for proper detoxification, and for some, they can be surprisingly difficult to get through a normal diet alone.</p>

<p>Be sure to visit a reputable supplement store and talk about your dietary needs with a knowledgeable person.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to consult your healthcare professional before undertaking any supplement regimen as healthcare needs vary from person to person.</p></li>

<li><p>Work It Out</p>

<p>Besides being good for your waistline, getting in some vigorous exercise daily rids your body of toxins and boosts your immune system to protect it from future contaminants.</p>

<p>Increasing your heart rate, expanding your lungs, and getting your blood pumping are all essential to flushing food wastes, bacteria, and environmental pollutants out of your system.</p>

<p>Putting your body to work for twenty  minutes, three times a week, is sufficient for making sure that the organs involved in detoxification—the colon, liver, lungs, kidneys, skin, and lymph glands—are functioning properly.</p></li>

<li><p>Fast Yourself Clean</p>

<p>One of the more extreme ways to detox, fasting helps your body to reset itself so that it can better recognize the contaminants inside of it.</p>

<p>You see, when your body gets used to a certain way of eating and drinking, it can be more difficult for it to sort out the harmful substances it has come to recognize on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The other thing about your body is that it is homeostatic, or self-correcting. You just have to hit the reset button.</p>

<p>Doing a water fast for three days may be more than what you can handle, but many people have seen a lot of success with intermittent fasting.</p>

<p>The most basic way to do this is to limit the time you eat to a 12-hour period—finishing dinner by 8pm and only consuming water or tea until 8am the next day.</p></li>

<li><p>Detox Teas</p>

<p>Teas give your body that added punch to put the detoxification process into overdrive.</p>

<p>Tea should really be the only flavored drink in your life. Don’t fall for claims about diet drinks being healthier than others. And though coffee has certain health benefits, more than two cups per day can be detrimental to your overall health. Tea, on the other hand, is safe for all day consumption.</p>

<p>Black and green teas are both rich in antioxidants that clear your body of damaging free radicals. But, did you know that there are numerous ingredients that can be added to tea that can produce a greater detoxification effect?</p>

<p>The best ingredients to look for when shopping for a tea that will promote healthy detoxification include turmeric, ginseng, lemongrass, orange peel, roots, and mints.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Be warned. You might experience some mood swings in the first few days of detoxing. Think of it as your body’s way of breaking its unknown addiction to the chemicals that have been poisoning your system.</p>

<p>With enough time and effort, though, you will find that keeping your system running clean will not only improve your appearance, but it will also improve your mood.</p>

<p>Happiness, after all, is the true goal of whole-body health.</p>
